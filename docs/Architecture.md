# ElevateMind: System Architecture

This document outlines the system architecture of the ElevateMind mental wellness application.  The architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and security.

## System Overview:

ElevateMind employs a three-tier architecture, consisting of a frontend, backend API, and a database.  These tiers interact via well-defined interfaces, promoting modularity and ease of development and maintenance.

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|     Frontend    | <--> |      Backend API     | <--> |      Database    |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
  (React, etc.)         (Node.js, Express.js)      (MongoDB)
                                     |
                                     v
                            Cloudinary (Image Storage)
                                     |
                                     v
                         Email Service (Nodemailer)
                                     |
                                     v
                          Google Cloud Platform 


```

**1. Frontend (Client-Side):**

* **Technology:** React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Chart.js
* **Responsibilities:** Handles user interaction, displays data from the backend API, renders interactive charts, and manages user authentication through JWTs.  Uses HTTPS to communicate securely with the backend.
* **Deployment:** Render (or similar cloud platform)

**2. Backend API (Server-Side):**

* **Technology:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Responsibilities:**  Handles all API requests, including user authentication (JWTs, bcrypt), data validation, business logic (check-in processing, trend analysis), data access (MongoDB via Mongoose), image processing (integration with Cloudinary), email sending (via Nodemailer), and error handling.  Acts as a secure intermediary between the frontend and the database.
* **Deployment:** Render (or similar cloud platform)
* **Security Measures:**
    * JWT Authentication: Secure session management.
    * bcrypt Password Hashing: Protects user passwords.
    * HTTPS: Encrypts all communication.
    * Input Sanitization: Prevents XSS attacks.

**3. Database:**

* **Technology:** MongoDB
* **Responsibilities:** Stores persistent data, including user profiles, check-in entries, and potentially other user-related information.  Uses a schema defined with Mongoose for data modeling and validation.

**4. Third-Party Services:**

* **Cloudinary:** Handles storage, transformation, and delivery of user profile images.
* **Nodemailer:** Used to send emails for password resets, verification, and reminders.
* **Google Cloud Platform:**  Facilitates Google authentication if enabled.

## Data Flow:

1. **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the frontend (e.g., filling out a check-in form).
2. **API Request:** The frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend API using HTTPS.
3. **Backend Processing:** The backend API validates the request, performs any necessary processing (e.g., data transformation, business logic), and interacts with the database.
4. **Database Interaction:** The backend uses Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database to store or retrieve data.
5. **Response:** The backend sends an HTTP response back to the frontend with the results.
6. **Frontend Rendering:** The frontend receives the response and updates the UI to reflect the changes.


## Scalability and Maintainability:

* **Microservices (Future Consideration):** The architecture could be further improved by migrating to a microservices architecture to enhance scalability and independent deployment of components.
* **Containerization (Future Consideration):** Containerization (e.g., Docker) could improve deployment consistency and portability across different environments.
* **API Versioning:** Implement API versioning to facilitate future updates and maintain backward compatibility.
* **Modular Design:** The backend API is designed with a modular structure to improve maintainability and code reusability.
